# Greek-Fires-Dashboard
An attempt to create my first interactive Dashboard using Dash to present in an interactive format the fires per year.

This is my first attempt to create a Dashboard by using Plotly Dash. The data used is from Kaggle.com and [Baris Dincer](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/2000-2021-tunisiaisraelgreeceitaly-nasa)

Besides the data required I used the following libraries: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),[Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/), and the Mapbox Density Heatmap from [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-density-heatmaps/). Also used [Jupyter Dash](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash) to present the dash results by using the Jupyter Notebook.

The result is the following as in the photo, of course it is much better to use the interactivity of the dashboard, so in the direct future I will try to host it online (perhaps Heroku) so the result can be observed online.
